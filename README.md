# ACP (Automatic Channel Pruning)
As the convolutional neural network (CNN) gets deeper and wider in recent years, the requirements for the amount of data and hardware resources have gradually increased. Meanwhile, CNN also reveals salient redundancy in several tasks. The existing magnitude-based pruning methods are efficient, but the performance of the compressed network is unpredictable. While the accuracy loss after pruning based on the structure sensitivity is relatively slight, the process is time-consuming and the algorithm complexity is notable. In this article, we propose a novel automatic channel pruning method (ACP).
