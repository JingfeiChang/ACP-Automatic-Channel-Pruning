### Introduction
As the convolutional neural network (CNN) gets deeper and wider in recent years, the requirements for the amount of data and hardware resources have gradually increased. Meanwhile, CNN also reveals salient redundancy in several tasks. We propose a novel automatic channel pruning method (ACP).
The framework of the proposed ACP is as follows.

### Experimental Results
We prune some CNNs on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet dataset. The results are depicted as follows.
